__No table__

I will be sending a separate repo to show how a word template can be used to create a table.
There was some confusion, this functionality is still not available in the docx editor. 

__To run__

Download the repo, install the node_modules, create a .env file with your key as PDFTRONKEY and from the first level of the directory:
npm run dev
